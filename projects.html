            <p style="font-size: x-large; ">This was the end-of-year project for CSE, and was by far the most unique, intense, and educational of all that I did in this class this year. Spanning nearly a month from the start of spring break to the start of May, it required me and my groupmates to independently create a product that addressed a problem in society in a meaningful way. My role as front-end developer meant that I had to develop the website and UI, but this was far from easy. The main challenge was finding a way to integrate the backend code into the frontend, and through experimentation and guess-and-check, we were able to find a way to do so that was both simple and elegant.</p>

            <p style="font-size: x-large; ">This project occurred at the start of the 2nd semester, and acted as a summary of what we learned first semester. It mainly covered python and logic code, and forced the student to work diligently, debug, and focus on the details, all important characteristics necessary for success in a STEM field. For me, it taught me to prioritize these values, and to never settle for anything that is below my standards for myself. I learned a lot trhough this project, and it will stay with me forever.</p>
