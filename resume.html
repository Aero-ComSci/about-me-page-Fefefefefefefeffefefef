<h4 style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255)">Coursework</h4>
<p style="font-size: x-large; ">Throughout my years in school, I have had a bunch of coursework that have reflected certain values that I have. The rigour of the advanced classes that I take, combined with the necessity to outperfrom my peers in order to earn a good grade, have all forced me to become increasingly resilient and responsible for myself. My projects in CSE, as well as academic record in classes such as Honors Chemistry and Advanced Alegbra II, all reflect my ability to succeed in rigourous classes, and to be able to ourperform my peers if given the chance.</p>
<p>         </p>
<h4 style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255)">Prior Work Experience</h4>
<p style="font-size: x-large; ">I have experience being temporarily employed in certain situations. In middle school, I ran my own dog walking business during the height of the pandemic, when people were less willing to go outside by themselves. By taking advantgae of the situation, I was able to make myself some profit, and even raise my prices due to the demand for my service. Adding on, I also invest the money that I make, and my day-trading antics have become an integral part of me and who I am in regards to managing money and being financially successful. So far, this is all the work experience that I have, but I would like to have some experience working a 9 to 5, or something similar, in the tech industry one day in the future, as that is what I envision my first job to be, and it would be nice to gain some prior experience before I work it full time.</p>
<p>         </p>
<h4 style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255)">Specific Skills/Certification</h4>
<p style="font-size: x-large; ">My most prominent skill is perhaps my ability to stay calm under pressure. When things don't go well, I am able to stay cool minded and be reasonable in my approach to resolving the situation, unlike some other people. This makes me fit for roles in leadership positions, as I am able to lead groups of people without allowing my emotions to take control of my decision making in these instances. I have also gained many awards and accomplishments, a few being varsity tennis, a bronze Spanish 2 national exam medal, and great results at competitive debate tournaments. Through these, I reflect my ability to succeed in many things at once, and demonstrate that I am a well-rounded person.</p>
