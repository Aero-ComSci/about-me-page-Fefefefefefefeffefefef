    <p>Smart, Hardworking, Caring</p>
<h2 style="color: rgb(28, 12, 130)">Career Goal</h2>

<p style="font-size: x-large; ">Ready to change the world? Ready to embark on the journey of a lifetime? Well, my name is Felix, and I am here to help you do just exactly that! For my career, I hope to one day be an entrepreneur, either in the tech or medical industries. I am passionate about STEM, and harnessing mathematics and engineering to help the world develop new technological advances. I want to continue pursuing these interests in high school, and manage to enroll in a STEM related career in college to stay on track in my pursuit of helping the world through technology.</p>
<p>         </p>
<p style="font-size: x-large; ">Some of my strengths include an ability to lead people and understand people's emotions. I am able to naturally understand what people are feeling toa a very specific degree so that I can assertivly get my point across while also making sure that the other indiidual views me as respectful and knowledgeable. I am also cooperative, and willing to work with individuals from a spectrum of backgrounds in order to help turn a shared goal into reality. Through my participation in school clubs, tennis (a sport that I have been playing for nearly a decade), and academic achievements, I strive to produce work of similar quality in whatever workplace I may find myself in.</p>
<p></p>
<p  style="font-size: x-large; ">From my experiences, I've learned that it is more important to be willing to learn than to know more than others. There is so much knowledge out there, and allowing yourself to find fulfillment in the pursuit of knowledge rather than current amount and depth of knowledge encourages a growth mindset that ultimately sets up individuals for greater success. The same goes for multiple aspects of life, including goalsetting. Rather than set a fixed goal that may be reached within a set time, set a goal that builds upon itself so you continuously aim to be better, no matter how good you currently are at a certain aspect of life. My work experience has taught me that it is much easier to find motivation when encouragement stems from one's willingness to become better rather than their want to obtain a certain status.</p>

<h2 style="color: rgb(28, 12, 130)">Resume</h2>
<h4 style="color: rgb(28, 12, 130)">Coursework</h4>
<p style="font-size: x-large; ">Throughout my years in school, I have had a bunch of coursework that have reflected certain values that I have. The rigour of the advanced classes that I take, combined with the necessity to outperfrom my peers in order to earn a good grade, have all forced me to become increasingly resilient and responsible for myself. My projects in CSE, as well as academic record in classes such as Honors Chemistry and Advanced Alegbra II, all reflect my ability to succeed in rigourous classes, and to be able to ourperform my peers if given the chance.</p>
<p>         </p>
<h4 style="color: rgb(28, 12, 130)">Prior Work Experience</h4>
<p style="font-size: x-large; ">I have experience being temporarily employed in certain situations. In middle school, I ran my own dog walking business during the height of the pandemic, when people were less willing to go outside by themselves. By taking advantgae of the situation, I was able to make myself some profit, and even raise my prices due to the demand for my service. Adding on, I also invest the money that I make, and my day-trading antics have become an integral part of me and who I am in regards to managing money and being financially successful. So far, this is all the work experience that I have, but I would like to have some experience working a 9 to 5, or something similar, in the tech industry one day in the future, as that is what I envision my first job to be, and it would be nice to gain some prior experience before I work it full time.</p>
<p>         </p>
<h4 style="color: rgb(28, 12, 130)">Specific Skills/Certification</h4>
<p style="font-size: x-large; ">My most prominent skill is perhaps my ability to stay calm under pressure. When things don't go well, I am able to stay cool minded and be reasonable in my approach to resolving the situation, unlike some other people. This makes me fit for roles in leadership positions, as I am able to lead groups of people without allowing my emotiosn to take control of my decision making in these instances. I have als ogained many awards and accomplishments, a few being varsity tennis, a bronze Spanish 2 national exam medal, and great results at competitive debate tournaments. Through these, I reflect my ability to succeed in many things at once, and demonstrate that I am a well-rounded person.</p>

<h2 style="color: rgb(28, 12, 130)">Projects</h2>
<h4 style="color: rgb(28, 12, 130)">Project 1 - Entrepreneurship Project</h4>
<p style="font-size: x-large; ">This was the end-of-year project for CSE, and was by far the most unique, intense, and educational of all that I did in this class this year. Spanning nearly a month from the start of spring break to the start of may, it required me and my groupmates to independently create a product that addressed a problem in society in a meaningful way. My role as front-end developer meant that I had to develop the website and UI, but this was far from easy. The main challenge was finding a way to integrate the backend code into the frontend, and through experiemntation and guess-and-check, we were able to find a way to do so that was both simple and elegant.</p>

<p>         </p>
<h4 style="color: rgb(28, 12, 130)">Project 2 - Menu Code</h4>
<p style="font-size: x-large; ">This project occurred at the start of the 2nd semester, and acted as a summary of what we learned first semester. It mainly covered python and logic code, and forced the student to work diligently, debug, and focus on the details, all important characteristics necessary for success in a STEM field. For me, it taught me to prioritize these values, and to never settle for anything that is below my standards for myself. I learned a lot trhough this project, and it will stay with me forever.</p>
